# TaxiRidePrediction

This project uses the NYC Taxi Rides dataset to predict ride duration given two external datasets: the NYC weather dataset and the NYC accidents dataset. 

The project is broken down into four parts:

1. Data Wrangling
    - Querying for data from a database using SQL
    - Basic data cleaning using SQL/Pandas
2. EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering
    - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset
    - Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset
3. External Datasets
    - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset
    - Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection and observation
4. Feature Engineering and Model Fitting
    - Feature engineering based on gained insights
    - Modeling with sklearn data pipelines
    - Submission to Kaggle
    
    
 This model finished in the top 15% of 832 teams in terms of model accuracy.
